## Execution Protocol

**No initial prompt.** When user provides a ticket ID, IMMEDIATELY begin analysis per CLAUDE.md execution protocol.

**Input parsing:**

| User Input | Format | Feedback |
|------------|--------|----------|
| `HM-14200` | comprehensive (default) | interactive (default) |
| `HM-14200 brief` | brief | interactive |
| `HM-14200 both` | both reports | interactive |
| `HM-14200 --no-feedback` | comprehensive | static Section 10 |

---

## Report Format Options

| Format | Word Limit | Audience | Output Location |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| `brief` | 450 words | PR Authors, Reviewers | `reports/code-review/<TICKET-ID>-code-review-brief.md` |
| `comprehensive` | 1300 words | QA Team, Tech Leads | `reports/code-review/<TICKET-ID>-code-review.md` |
| `both` | N/A | Generate both | Both files |

**Default:** `comprehensive`

**Word count exception:** Section 10 (Developer Feedback) is excluded from word count.

### Content Filtering (Brief vs Comprehensive)

| Content Type | Brief | Comprehensive |
|--------------|-------|---------------|
| Critical Issues | All (collapsed) | All (expanded) |
| High/Medium/Low Issues | Excluded | All |
| Test Coverage | Counts only | Full tables with file:line |
| Hotfix Patterns | Failed only | All 6 with status |
| Questions for Author | Excluded | All |
| Regression Impact | Excluded | Full table |
| Code Snippets | Excluded | 5-10 lines max |

## Workflow

```
User provides ticket ID (+ optional format/flags)
        |
        v
Step 1: Auto-detect repository
        |  - Search ALL repos for branch (per CLAUDE.md)
        |  - Report: "Found in <repo>"
        |  - If not found: STOP, report which repos were checked
        |
        v
Step 2: Filter commits by ticket ID (per CLAUDE.md)
        |  - Report: "Branch contains X total, analyzing Y specific to <TICKET>"
        |
        v
Step 3: Get branch diff statistics
        |
        v
Step 4: Spawn sub-agent tasks (parallel)
        |  ├── A. Code Change Analyzer
        |  │     - Per-file analysis, bugfix pattern checks
        |  │     - Apply false positive prevention rules
        |  ├── B. Test Coverage Analyzer
        |  │     - Fetch E2E repos first (per CLAUDE.md)
        |  │     - Testability, unit tests, E2E coverage
        |  └── C. Regression Impact Analyzer
        |        - Downstream consumers, integration points
        |
        v
Step 5: Generate report(s) per format selection
        |  - Follow exact template structure
        |  - Validate word count (see prompt for enforcement rules)
        |
        v
Step 6: Present summary to user
        |
        v
Step 7: Interactive Developer Feedback (default, skip with --no-feedback)
        |  - See feedback protocol below
```

## Sub-Agent Failure Handling

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Branch not found in any repo | **STOP.** Report which repos were checked. |
| 0 ticket-specific commits | Analyze all commits with warning. |
| Sub-agent returns incomplete results | Note gap: "⚠️ Incomplete — [reason]". Continue with available data. |
| E2E repo unreachable | Note failure in Section 4.2. Continue with available repos. |

---

## Interactive Developer Feedback (Step 7)

**Default ON.** Skip only if user explicitly says `--no-feedback`.

### 7.1 Collect Findings

Extract all findings with warning or failure status from:
- **Section 3.2** (Hotfix Pattern Prevention table)
- **Section 6** (Issues Found — all severities)

Build a numbered list.

### 7.2 Present Findings in Batches

Use `AskUserQuestion` to present up to 4 findings at a time.

**Fallback:** If `AskUserQuestion` unavailable, present as numbered list. Ask developer to reply with verdict numbers.

**For each finding, 4 options:**
- **"Valid"** — Accurate, will address
- **"False Positive"** — Incorrect or doesn't apply
- **"Won't Fix"** — Valid but accepted risk
- **"Provide More Information"** — Need deeper analysis

### 7.3 Handle "Provide More Information"

1. Read `prompts/code-review-qa/findings-detailed-template.md`
2. Read actual code at flagged location
3. Search for sibling/related patterns in codebase
4. Assess probability and impact
5. Generate detailed analysis, append to `reports/code-review/<TICKET>-findings-detailed.md`
6. Present summary, ask final verdict (Valid / False Positive / Won't Fix — no "More Info" this time)

### 7.4 Finalize Report

1. Update Section 10 with developer verdicts
2. Save feedback JSON to `reports/feedback/<TICKET>-feedback.json`

**Severity derivation:**
- Section 6 findings: use finding's severity (Critical → `"critical"`, Warning → `"warning"`, Suggestion → `"suggestion"`)
- Section 3.2 findings: `fail` → `"warning"`, `warn` → `"suggestion"`. Only `fail`/`warn` included — `pass` excluded.
- `deep_analysis_requested`: `true` for any finding where developer selected "Provide More Information"

**Feedback JSON structure:** See `prompts/feedback/feedback-template.md` for schema.

3. Present final summary:
```
Interactive Feedback Complete for <TICKET>

Results:
- Valid: X findings
- False Positive: X findings
- Won't Fix: X findings
- Deep Analysis Provided: X findings

Report updated: reports/code-review/<TICKET>-code-review.md (Section 10)
Detailed analysis: reports/code-review/<TICKET>-findings-detailed.md
Feedback saved: reports/feedback/<TICKET>-feedback.json
```

---

## Predictive Bug Detection

Proactive scan for patterns that historically cause production hotfixes. Read `context/historical-bugfix-patterns.md` for the repo-specific pattern table, then check every pattern against each changed file. Flag findings with severity and file:line.

---

## Constraints

- **Brief report:** Maximum 450 words — HARD FAIL if exceeded
- **Comprehensive report:** Maximum 1300 words — HARD FAIL if exceeded
- Prioritize actionable insights, use tables and bullet points
- Always include file:line references
- **Critical test checklist:** 3-5 scenarios maximum
- **Never auto-generate acceptance tests** (separate agent: `@hb-acceptance-tests`)
- Reference acceptance tests agent in Section 9
- Branch commit filtering per CLAUDE.md
- No checkout — use `git fetch` + remote refs
- Keyword-first search for E2E tests
