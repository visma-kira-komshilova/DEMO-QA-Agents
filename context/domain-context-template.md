## How Agents Use This File

1. **Identify functional area** from the ticket (e.g., Invoicing, Payroll, User Management)
2. **Load matching domain file:** `context/domain-<area>.md`
3. **Cross-reference requirements** against regulatory rules and business rules below
4. **Flag gaps** where requirements don't address mandatory domain constraints
5. **Include domain-specific edge cases** in analysis that generic checks would miss

**Decision Logic:**
- Ticket mentions [area keywords]? → Load this file
- Requirements touch [external system]? → Check Integration Requirements section
- Feature involves [calculations/dates/amounts]? → Check Validation Rules section
- Feature has [compliance deadlines]? → Check Compliance Calendar section

## Common Edge Cases (Domain-Specific)

> Scenarios that generic edge case checklists miss but are critical in this domain.

| Scenario | Required Behavior | Regulatory Basis | Severity if Missed |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| [Domain-specific scenario, e.g., "Invoice with zero amount and multiple tax rates"] | [What should happen, e.g., "Reject with validation error; log attempt"] | [Regulation or N/A, e.g., "Tax authority reporting rules"] | Critical / High / Medium |
| [Domain-specific scenario] | [What should happen] | [Regulation or N/A] | Critical / High / Medium |

---

## Validation Rules

## Maintenance Notes

**When to update this file:**
- Regulatory changes (new laws, updated deadlines, changed thresholds)
- New business rules discovered from production incidents
- Domain expert review reveals inaccuracies
- New external system integrations added

**Review cadence:** Quarterly or after any regulatory change

**`[VERIFY]` tags:** Items marked `[VERIFY]` need domain expert confirmation before being treated as authoritative. Agents should still flag these items in analysis but note the verification status.
